Garge, a world where a super-intelligent race once thrived, has 
long been a wasteland of its previouse apocalypse. Since that last 
apocalypse, new creatures such as a race of super-intelligent blob arose. 
Bubba, a young blob who has taken an apprenticeship to a renowned 
weapons dealer: Krepi to learn how to build advanced weapon technology 
and gadgets(and of course to earn a living). One day, a race of super-intelligent 
rats from a distant planet,known as the Regrian invaded Garge and have taken 
control of it. Although, the rats ruled with cruelty over the blobs, 
Bubba didn't mind. However, things changed. One day, Bubba's master, Krepi disappeared. 
Finding the note left on the door, he discovered that Krepi's disappearance 
was the Regrians' doing. Now Bubba seeks revenge, to get his friend back along 
with his world.
