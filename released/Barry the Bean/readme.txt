1) About


	This game was abandoned by Batel for a while, so I(Snerlin) decided
to take up the job to finish this game. And, so for a few months, I spent my
game dev time working on this game. This game just had to be finished. The gameplay
of this game really reflects that of Sweet Legends: you jump and shoot your way through
huge levels and gain new abilities along the way.

This is a game about a war between beans and fireants. It's a story of bloodshed,
REVENGE, and .....atomic banana bombs.


-------------------------------


2) Plot


	The beans of the Great Bean Kingdom were sleeping quietly one night, not
knowing what would soon take place. Suddenly, they heard a SNAP! Before they even
woke up, they knew what was wrong. "Fireants!", they screamed! Many were killed
in the massacre, the rest were taken prisoner. One bean, Barry, hid behind a cornstalk
until the onslaught was over. Barry now vowed that he will kill the ant queen and
rescue his colony of beans.
