About the game:

	Legalize It! was started in Fall 2006 as a game to be contributed
toward the Teatons Project. The theme of the game is based off a Teatons
meme created by Snerlin involving cat girls holding signs advocating the
legalization of tacos. The game was abandoned for a long time soon after the main level
and one boss were completed. Thankfully, Snerlin eventually got back to it 
and finished up the rest. It also has four-color Gameboy-ish
kind of theme for no reason really. All the levels of the game are entirely 
generated at random.

Plot:

	There isn't really much of a plot to the game. You play as Arzel Blatimus,
a cat girl taco fanatic, forcing the marvels of tacos upon the inhabitants of 
alien planets. Then for some reason you fight an extra-dimensional moose at the end.

--------------------------------------------------

Notes:

-ninjas and space cows are immune to Magic Missiles
-zombies are immune to Lightguns
-If you get stuck, Magic Missiles can destroy platforms to clear a path. 

-You lunge forward quickly when you attack with your sign. You can use this to give you an extra boost
 to get out of an enemy's way.

-When you get hurt, you become invincible for a couple of seconds. Use this time to your advantage
 to either score some hits on the enemies or dodge them entirely.

-ESC quits the game at any time
-You can press Alt + Enter to switch to full-screen

-In case you're wondering, the Japanese text on the title screen says
"Yum Yum Taco"
