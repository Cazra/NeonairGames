1: about

	On the Daily Click(a game developement community site), Frogger games have been
popping up in around mid December. So, I decided to take a shot at a Frogger retro and
better the other Frogger games. After working hard for half a month, I created this.
I hope you enjoy it.

3:plot

	After his battle with Gimloth to save Wisdom Realms, Waller took his master's
place as the Dark Archmage and as Taun's apprentice. When Waller was on a quest for Taun,
he stumbled onto the property of an ascetic wicked witch named Warta the Witch. She became
furious at Waller and turned him into a frog to eat for dinner. Fortunately, Waller escaped
and found Taun. Taun told Waller that to cure himself, he must find a legendary 
Groovy Pepper. However, the pepper cannot be found in Waller and Taun's world. So, Taun
cast a spell on Waller to let him travel through different worlds.
