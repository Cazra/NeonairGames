About (*A)

This is the first RPG I’ve ever made. I made it for a mini-RPG competition at The Daily Click in which we had to make a mini-RPG in about 5 days. Pretty tough challenge, eh? Indeed. I didn’t finish the entire RPG in time for the competition, but at least what I had finished was enough to get it in. It had a separate battle system, at least 2 quests, and at least 15 minutes of gameplay. However, the version I released for the competition was probably just a third of the finished game. This finished version has a lot more stuff such as a save feature, no more random encounters( you can see your enemies in the dungeons and attempt to dodge them),  allies, easier enemies, etc. Randomness got the most votes in the competition and got first place, so I’m quite proud of it. Anyways, I hope you enjoy your adventure in Ran d’ Omness.

*****************************
Story (*S)

Snerlin was up late again trying to finish his RPG for the competition when he accidentally divided by zero and opened up a portal to another dimension. A royally-dressed peanut named Billy popped out of the portal and stole all of Snerlin’s games. Snerlin chased after Billy into the portal to try to get his games back. Unfortunately for Snerlin, Billy brought along his pet experimental stickman which beats the crap out of Snerlin sending him falling from the sky into a magic spring in a forest. Here Snerlin wakes up and discovers that he is in a world called Ran d’ Omness. His first step would be to get out of the spooky forest in which he landed and then he must find Billy and get his games back. This is where Snerlin’s adventures in Ran d’ Omness begin.

Tips and Hints (*T)
************************************************


Sushi roll Locations: (*1)

-	Burnt cookie forest ( in the area with the creek, go down the south path to come to a treasure chest containing a sushi roll)

-	Sonhu village ( own the 12-year-old noob pker to get 5 sushi rolls. Suggested level to fight him on: 8+)

-	Sonhu castle (after defeating the meteorologist imps, look in the fridge to find a sushi roll.

-	Sonhu village ( defeat Grup and he’ll give you 2 sushi rolls. They’re half digested but still perfectly good. So don’t be a whiner.)

-	Billy’s fortress ( go east from the locked door. In this hallway, go into the small room. You’ll find 2 treasure chests. One of them contains 3 sushi rolls.)

-	Billy’s fortress ( in the hallway just through the locked door, go east to find a treasure chest with a sushi roll.)



Shiny weapons (*2)

At the beginning of the dungeon where you find Esla, go west and you’ll find a small room with Grup’s shiny weapon.

	In the second room with the large shrubbery, go north from the entrance and make your way through the maze of fence posts to find a small room with Snerlin’s shiny weapon.

	In the next room, just before the bridge that leads to the exit, go along the path to the west. You’ll come into a small room with Esla’s shiny weapon.



Bestiary (*3)

-	Closet monster( Snerlin’s laundry basket. It has a scary smiley face on it and 2 spooky claws to do massive spooky damage to you. To beat it, just use magic the entire fight. You should escape with barely any HP left.

-	Burnt cookie( These burnt cookies are the nice and fluffy inhabitants of the Burnt Cookie Woods. They’re pretty easy to beat.)

-	Gooberling( This is a short, skinny, green guy who likes to pick his nose. He can also pick his friend’s nose. They also like to try to pick YOUR nose.)

-	Ice blob( This monster is all that remains of a snowman who melted and was too evil to go to snowman heaven. They absorb ice magic, but are weak against fire )

-	Natural log( The natural log is the guardian of the burnt cookie forest. His real name is Euler. He shoots Pi’s at all intruders who harm the cute fluffy burnt cookies to condense them into a cube. )

-	Levitating llama( These llamas have capes and float about 1 foot off the ground. They also speak Spanish. Nobody understands Spanish in Ran d’ Omness, so anyone that hears these llamas speak suffers from headaches so bad that they can’t remember a thing!)

-	Cute fluffy adamantium bunny( this cute little bunny is made out of adamantium, one of the hardest substances in all RPGs. These bunnies like to attack random adventurers and are almost impenetrable!)

-	12-year-old noob pker( this is a noobish pker who roams the land slaughtering people and has no life outside of mmorpgs. Watch out, if he gets angry, he might go all super sayan on you!)

-	Meteorologist imp( this is an imp who likes to predict the weather and raid villages daily. Half the time though, these guys don’t predict the weather correctly and accidentally summon a meteor shower.)

-	Ramen elemental( this is the elemental essence of ramen. Because these guys are pure ramen, they know kung fu, they can use chop sticks, and they’re extra spicy! They’ll absorb fire magic, but will succumb to ice)

-	Vile photosynthesis blob( these green blobs are the toxic fecal excrements of the deadly shrubby doom shrubbs that grow in the meteorologist imps’ shrubberies. They will use photosynthesis to heal themselves when weak.

-	Shrubby doom shrubb( this evil shrubb of doom grows in the new shrubberies built by the meteorologist imps. It releases toxic spores to slowly kill off people it doesn’t like and it weilds a deadly scythe.)

-	Pot of Petunias( Achoo!!! Excuse me….allergies….my head hurts and I can’t remember a thing….)

-	Cheese Golem( This is a golem made from nacho cheese infused with magic to give it a life of its own which involves dripping molten cheese everywhere, attacking everyone it sees, and making delicious nachos.)

-	Grup( He’s a mushroom and a pirate. He also has a neat-looking airship.)

-	Stick midget( these are like stickmen, only smaller.)

-	Pajama ninja( these are low budget ninjas who use their pajamas for their costumes. They are notably deadly for their ninja poking skills.)

-	Fiery death cookie( this fiery cookie is burning with the pure essence of death and food poisoning. It’s also way too hot to eat. It’ll absorb fire, but ice will cool it down.)

-	Resized Sprite( this sprite used to be really small but then was force-fed giant growth potion by a mad scientist. It’s still quite weak despite its size and cannot harm anyone at all, but it’s immune to magic and it turns its foes into wussies with library graphics of wusiness. )

-	Anime succubus more morally clothed than most succubi( this succubus was hired by Billy to protect the treasure in his castle. Unlike most succubi, she has higher morals and doesn’t wear clothes as revealing as most succubi do.)

-	Large wooden record player( Billy listens to his large wooden record player all the timeday and night. He only plays one song on it too. The song happens to be highly annoying circus music which enfeebles and gives headaches to all who hear it.)

-	Cramped styrofoam golem( this is a colossal golem made of Styrofoam who is way to large for the game’s window and suffers from being really cramped.)

-	Sandwitch( he came from a far away land and is often made fun of because of his name. However, he is an expert in magic and can breath deadly pastries to inflict all kinds of status effects on his enemies.)

-	Experimental stickman( this stickman escaped from a mad scientists lab and now Billy keeps it as a pet. It knows kung fu and can blast its opponents to smithereens with its magic rocket.)

-	Billy the Flying Peanut King( he stole your games and you hate him.)

-	Bob Named Moo Named Spanky( I’m not telling….spoilers….)

-	Ichiman( The Japanese Kanji for ten thousand)
