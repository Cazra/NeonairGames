1: About

	Batel saw the message for a competition in which we have to make a game
involving giant robots(like Gundams, Mech, etc.). We worked on the game for 2 weeks
and entered it. Because of the file size limit for the competition( 1 mb ), this version of
the game isn't very long. The full version that we'll release later will have more levels,
2 player mode, and a built-in help file.

-----------------------------

2: Plot

	A merciless race of biomechanical beings known by us as Droners
has come from a distant dying solar system.
They keep their star alive by fueling it with the pure cores of other planets.
They did not expect us to fight back, however. Now they are sending armies of Biomechanical
soldiers down to destroy all human life to prevent our interference with their plans.
As one of the last Nova-riders, you must use your Nova Armor to destroy the Droner
mothership before it blasts away the surface of the Earth to harvest the core.
