Thank you for downloading what I have completed so far of Christmas Conquest 2.
Please note that the game is still unfinished, so not all the levels are available to play yet
and there may be some bugs left and some things that just don't work yet 
(e.g. the weapon you get from Cupid hasn't been implemented on some levels).



---Controls:

Arrow keys --- move

Shift ---- jump

Ctrl ---- fire

Enter --- pause/weapon select

up --- grab onto/climb up ladders

down --- climb down ladders

hold down + Shift --- slide



you can exit the game at any time by pressing Alt + 4


Please enjoy! 






---Level warps:

Since this game is still in development, I've made warp keys that will send you to different parts of the level
you're in. 

Genenrally, pressing 1 will send you to the checkpoint and pressing 2 will send you to the level's boss.

You can press 1 on the title screen to skip the intro level.

You can press 2 on the title screen to warp to the final boss level.
